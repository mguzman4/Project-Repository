    <h3>Pizza Reviews</h3>
    <h4>Here you'll find some personal and unprofessional reviews on various different pizzas.</h4>
    <img src="images/pizza10.JPG" alt="pizza" title="pizza">
    <h4>Charcoal Guido's Rustic Italian Kitchen | Waltham, MA</h4>
    <p>After first walking into the Boston Pizza Festival, I quickly discovered that Nutella Pizza was an option that I couldn't pass up. This nutella and ricotta cheese filled calzone type pizza that is topped perfectly with powdered sugar and strawberries is absolutely delectable. As you can see in the picture, it's quite messy, but so worth it. It'll have you licking your fingers and wanting more. </p>

    <h4>Posto Mobile | Boston,MA</h4>
    <p>Across from South Station, there are usually food trucks. Posto is a mobile food truck that makes wood-fired pizza and is part of the Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana. I decided to try their chicken bbq pizza. The pizza had just the right amount of Parmesan and mozzarella and was cooked well. The sweet bbq sauce and onions helped add that extra touch and reminded me of Nashville. It paired really nicely with sparkling water.</p>

    <h4>Five Points Pizza | Nashville, TN</h4>
    <p>
    Five Points Pizza in East Nashville is usually my go to pizza spot. I normally never eat garlic knots but this place has amazing garlic knots that will chaneg your life.</p> 
    </p>

    <h4>Pieology | Franklin, TN</h4>
    <p>While I was back home, my friend suggested we go to try Pieology. In case you aren't familiar with Pie Five or Pieology, they're basically the pizza equivalent to Subway. You get to pick your crust, sauce, and toppings. Then, they quickly bake it in their magical oven and BAM your personal pizza is ready to be devoured. Anyways, I got what I usually get at Pie Five (regular crust with every cheese they have and some meat). This place had more cheeses than Pie Five, better customer service, and really tasty pizza. Although Pie Five will always hold a special place in my heart, Pieology is now my favorite place to get personalized pizzas. I really wish they had more locations in Tennessee though.
